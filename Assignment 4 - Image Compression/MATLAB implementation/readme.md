# Image-Compression using MATLAB

Basic Implementation of JPEG Compression <br>
~~~
Run test.m file to compress an image to JPEG <br>
~~~
Each of the pipeline matlab functions are commented inside. <br>


**Question** <br>
1. Using your fav. Programming language (Matlab, Python etc.) simulate the “Basic J-PEG <br>
coding” to compress and uncompress images. Hint: Follow block diagram in the slide #30. <br><br>
2. Demonstrate the program to the GA, show the output step by step and SUBMIT REPORT. <br>
Hints: Use the lecture note as a step by step guide to write your code in Matlab. Bonus Point: If <br>
you are enthusiastic try out almost full version of JPEG.
